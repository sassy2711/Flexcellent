# Yoga Pose Corrector

## Overview

**Yoga Pose Corrector** is a computer vision-based application that detects yoga poses in real-time and provides instant feedback on the correctness of the posture. Using OpenCV and machine learning, the app identifies key pose landmarks and compares them against ideal reference poses, helping users correct their yoga postures efficiently. The project also includes audio feedback for hands-free usage, making it user-friendly for home workouts.

## Features

- Real-time yoga pose detection using computer vision.
- Comparison of user pose with ideal pose landmarks for accuracy.
- Instant feedback on posture correction.
- Audio guidance for hands-free usage.
- Supports multiple yoga poses.
- Cross-platform compatibility (mobile/desktop).
